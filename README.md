# Solar System Moons Analysis 🌌

## Overview 📖
Dive into an analytical journey through the Solar System, exploring the diverse moons orbiting our planets and potential dwarf planets. Utilizing comprehensive data from Wikipedia, this project aims to uncover and understand the characteristics and patterns of these natural satellites.

## Data Source 🗂
Our celestial dataset is sourced from [Wikipedia's List of Natural Satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_natural_satellites#List), offering a detailed catalog of the Solar System's recognized moons.

## Objectives 🎯
1. **Data Importation**: Load the dataset into a DataFrame and display the first ten rows for a preliminary view.
2. **Data Cleaning and Validation**:
   - 🛠 Rename columns for clarity and broader accessibility.
   - 🔀 Reorder columns to prioritize readability and analytical flow.
   - 🗝 Establish a unique index for efficient data identification and retrieval.
   - 🧼 Clean and process selected columns with distinct techniques, including regular expressions for precision.
3. **Research and Analysis**: Develop and explore a research question that delves deep into the dataset, aiming for insightful analysis and interpretations.
4. **Data Visualization**: Create a compelling visualization that highlights the key findings from the analysis.

## Running the Notebook 🚀
- Ensure the installation of Jupyter Notebook and all required Python libraries (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`).
- Download or clone this repository to access the Jupyter Notebook file.
- Open the notebook in Jupyter and execute the cells to witness the data transformation, analysis, and visualization phases.

## Data Cleaning and Validation Strategy 🧹
- Column names are thoughtfully renamed, and their order reorganized to facilitate intuitive understanding and analysis.
- A suitable indexing strategy enhances data manipulation and analysis efficiency.
- Detailed attention is given to cleaning and processing four specific columns, each employing unique data cleaning techniques and regular expressions for accuracy and clarity.

## Research Question and Analysis 🔍
Centered around a meticulously chosen research question, the project delves into the dataset to extract meaningful insights, documented comprehensively within the notebook.

## Data Visualization 📊
A meticulously designed visualization complements the analytical narrative, providing a visual summary of the research findings and enhancing understanding.
